# Calculator project
This is a simple calculator app built using React

### Main Concepts

- **Conditional Rendering**: Display different UI elements based on the application's state.
- **Destructuring**: Extract values from arrays or objects into distinct variables.
- **Functional Programming**: Utilize methods like `map` handle data.
- **useContext**: Manage global state across the application.
- **useState**: Handle component-level state.
- **Redux**: Handle the default state , set value to default state and reset state

### What I learned

- How to use Context api and Redux for global state management 
- A better understanding of conditional rendering
